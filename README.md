# Data Extraction

We extracted data by searching the languages individually their influenced by and influenced. The source of the link is below.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages

We couldn't extracted all the languages because it was too many instead we selected randomly from every alphabet and also selected those languages which are popular or commonly used world wide.  

# About the Graph
